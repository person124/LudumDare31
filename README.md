Ludum Dare 31
===========
*sigh* Another Ludum Dare gone by. It feels like only yesterday that was learning java. Whelp, the game that I made this year is called: Indecisive Gamer, and is shite. I didn't expect it to be that good, due to time constraints beyond the 48 hour one, and I think it came out okay considering. If I had more time I might have made it even better.
